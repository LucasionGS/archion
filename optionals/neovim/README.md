# Fuck

So, for some reason certain files were missing when I tried to install the plugins from NvChad. I thankfully had them in a different installation, so they are in here for convenience if they are missing.

If this happens for you, you can copy the files from here to your Neovim `base46` plugin directory.

`base46/*` => `~/.local/share/nvim/base46/*`
